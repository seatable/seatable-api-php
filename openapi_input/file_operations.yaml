        Then this file/image can be attached to a file/image column.

        ## Attach the file/image to a file or image column

        After uploading the file/image to a base, SeaTable saves the uploaded file at non-public URL in the form: `/workspace/{workspace_id}`+`parent_dir`+`relative_path`+`name`. 

        Here is an example how this might look like: `https://cloud.seatable.io/workspace/24/asset/55f2f056-5da1-4095-b5f8-791bb51b991e/images/2023-07/party.png`
        If you are logged in with your browser, you can access this file. Otherwise you will see the login screen.

        Knowing this URL, you can add a new row or update an existing row and use the URL to add this attachment to your file/image column.
        ```
        # Example how to add an already uploaded image to a row:
        "row": {
          "My Image Column": ["/workspace/24/asset/55f2f056-5da1-4095-b5f8-791bb51b991e/images/2023-07/party.png`"]
        }

        # Example how to add an already uploaded file to a row:
        "row": {
          "File Column": [{
            "name": "invoice.pdf", 
            "size": 101454, 
            "type": "file", 
            "url": "/workspace/24/asset/55f2f056-5da1-4095-b5f8-791bb51b991e/images/2023-07/invoice.pdf"
          }]
        }
        ```
        > 🚧 File requires the input variables size, type and url
        > 
        > As you can see, in the case of an image the URL is sufficient to attach the image to an image column. In case of a file, you have to provide all four input values.
